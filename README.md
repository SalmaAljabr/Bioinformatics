# Biology Toolbox: Python Scripts for Molecular Biology

# Overview
Welcome to the Biology Toolbox repository! This collection of Python scripts is designed to assist in various molecular biology tasks, offering functionalities crucial for a biology course. 
The scripts cover fundamental operations, including counting nucleotides, transcribing DNA to RNA, finding the complement of a DNA strand, and translating RNA to protein.

Table of Contents
  - [1. Counting Nucleotides]
  - [2. Transcribing DNA to RNA]
  - [3. Complementing a DNA Strand]
  - [4. Translating RNA to Protein]

Features
- Counting Nucleotides: Determine the frequency of each nucleotide in a given DNA sequence.
- Transcribing DNA to RNA: Convert a DNA sequence into its corresponding RNA sequence.
- Complementing a DNA Strand: Find the complementary strand of a given DNA sequence.
- Translating RNA to Protein: Translate an RNA sequence into its corresponding protein sequence.

> Note: This project was completed during the academic year 2022-2023 for the Biology course as a "freshman student".
